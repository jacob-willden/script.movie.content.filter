## Legal

The add-on does not alter video files at all, but instead lets "users choose to see or not to see parts of the content, and the app remembers their choice" (quoted from the Read Me file for the VideoSkip extension [here](https://github.com/fruiz500/VideoSkip-extension/blob/master/README.md), which extension's code this add-on is built on). It also does not enable unauthorized access to video files.

The streaming services that our add-on supports and the content from these streaming services belong to their respective copyright holders. We claim no affliation or endorsement from any of these copyright holders.

Notice to All Users: When watching a motion picture (referring to a movie, television show, etc) using this add-on, the performance of the motion picture is altered from the performance intended by the director or copyright holder of the motion picture.
